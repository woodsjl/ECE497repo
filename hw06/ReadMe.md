This is for assignment 6 for ECE 497
this program uses the beagle bone to track an IR light using phototransistors
and a stepper motor

In order to do this you will need to wire a H bridge inputs to 
used in the lightSeeker.js file and then the outputs to the stepper motor.
Wires will need to be run from the positive sides of each of the phototransistor
then run the lightSeeker.js file
